# Audio Filters for CW and SSB

Date: 2026-01-13

## Theory

- Audio filters improve intelligibility by limiting bandwidth.
- CW filters are narrow bandpass; SSB filters are wider.

## Design Calculations

- Set center frequency and bandwidth with RC or LC networks.
- Filter order determines selectivity and phase.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Not modeled in NEC; verify with SPICE or audio test sweeps.

## Winding Tables

- If LC filters are used, compute inductor turns for target L.

## 3D Printed Parts

- Panel controls, enclosure, and audio jack mounts.
