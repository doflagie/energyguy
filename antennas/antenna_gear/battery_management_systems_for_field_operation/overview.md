# Battery Management Systems for Field Operation

Date: 2026-01-13

## Theory

- BMS controls charging, balancing, and protection for cells.
- Protection thresholds prevent overcharge and deep discharge.

## Design Calculations

- Select pack voltage and capacity for duty cycle.
- Size charge rate based on cell C-rating.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Not modeled in NEC; validate with load tests.

## Winding Tables

- Not coil-based.

## 3D Printed Parts

- Battery tray, cable strain relief, and fuse holder mounts.
