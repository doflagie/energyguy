# Coaxial Cable Traps

Date: 2026-01-13

## Theory

- Coax traps are resonant sections that block current at a target band.
- They allow multiband dipoles and verticals without separate feeds.

## Design Calculations

- Quarter-wave length: L = (c / (4 * f)) * VF.
- Adjust for end effects and coil diameter if coiled.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Model as parallel LC or as a transmission line stub.

## Winding Tables

- If coiled, calculate turns to achieve the target electrical length.

## 3D Printed Parts

- Coil form, end caps, and weatherproof sealing.
