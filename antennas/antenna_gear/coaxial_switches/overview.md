# Coaxial Switches

Date: 2026-01-13

## Theory

- Coax switches route RF between antennas and radios.
- Isolation and contact resistance define performance.

## Design Calculations

- Verify power rating and VSWR across the frequency range.
- Account for insertion loss in the feed system.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Model each switch position as a separate feed point in NEC.

## Winding Tables

- Not coil-based.

## 3D Printed Parts

- Panel cutouts, knob plates, and gasketed housings.
