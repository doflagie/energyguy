# Field Strength Meters

Date: 2026-01-13

## Theory

- Field strength meters use a short antenna and detector to measure RF level.
- Relative readings are used for antenna tuning and pattern checks.

## Design Calculations

- Antenna length should be short relative to wavelength.
- Detector time constant sets response and stability.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Model as a short monopole in NEC for calibration curves.

## Winding Tables

- Not coil-based; focus on detector and probe geometry.

## 3D Printed Parts

- Probe housing, meter bezel, and battery holder.
