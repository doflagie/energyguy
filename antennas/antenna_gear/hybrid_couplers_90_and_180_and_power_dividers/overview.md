# Hybrid Couplers (90 and 180) and Power Dividers

Date: 2026-01-13

## Theory

- Hybrid couplers split power with defined phase relationships.
- Power dividers provide equal outputs with good isolation.

## Design Calculations

- Quarter-wave lines at the center frequency set phase.
- Characteristic impedance is often Z0 * sqrt(2) for 3 dB split.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Model with transmission line sections and phasing cables.

## Winding Tables

- Some HF hybrids use transformers; compute turns for balance.

## 3D Printed Parts

- PCB enclosure, connector mounts, and internal standoffs.
