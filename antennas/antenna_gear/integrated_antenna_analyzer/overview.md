## Theory

- Measures complex impedance using a bridge or VNA front end.
- Reference resistors and directional couplers set measurement accuracy.
- Calibration removes systematic errors.

## Design Calculations

- Dynamic range and detector linearity define usable power levels.
- Bridge balance equations solve for R and X.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Use NEC to generate expected impedance for comparison.
- Model feed line length effects with transmission line sections.

## Winding Tables

- Transformer windings may be needed for bridge isolation.

## 3D Printed Parts

- Enclosure, display bezel, battery tray, and RF connector mounts.
