# Lightning Arrestors and Surge Protection

Date: 2026-01-13

## Theory

- Gas discharge tubes and MOVs clamp transient voltages.
- A low-impedance ground path is essential for protection.

## Design Calculations

- Select standoff voltage above normal RF peak voltage.
- Check surge energy rating vs expected environment.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Not modeled in NEC; use grounding layout best practices.

## Winding Tables

- Not coil-based; focus on mechanical and grounding design.

## 3D Printed Parts

- Ground lug mounts, bulkhead plates, and drain holes.
