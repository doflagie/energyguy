# Motorized Coil Winder

Date: 2026-01-13

## Theory

- A coil winder controls turn count and spacing for repeatable inductors.
- Tension and traverse control impact accuracy and consistency.

## Design Calculations

- Turns per layer = coil length / wire diameter.
- Traverse pitch equals wire diameter plus insulation.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Not modeled in NEC; outputs are used to build antenna components.

## Winding Tables

- Generate turns tables for each target inductance and core.

## 3D Printed Parts

- Frame brackets, motor mounts, and wire guide blocks.
