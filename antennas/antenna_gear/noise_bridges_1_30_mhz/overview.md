# Noise Bridges (1-30 MHz)

Date: 2026-01-13

## Theory

- A noise bridge balances a known reference against an unknown impedance.
- The null indicates impedance match.

## Design Calculations

- Bridge balance equations solve R and X from the null position.
- Select reference resistors for target impedance range.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Use NEC to predict antenna impedance for comparison.

## Winding Tables

- Small RF transformers may require turns tables for balance.

## 3D Printed Parts

- Enclosure, control knobs, and RF connector panels.
