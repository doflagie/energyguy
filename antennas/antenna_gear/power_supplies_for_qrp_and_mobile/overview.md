# Power Supplies for QRP and Mobile

Date: 2026-01-13

## Theory

- Supplies must be low-noise to avoid RF hash.
- Switching supplies need filtering; linear supplies need heat sinking.

## Design Calculations

- Size current for peak transmit draw plus margin.
- Ripple and dropout calculations ensure stable voltage.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Not modeled in NEC; verify with load testing.

## Winding Tables

- Transformer turns tables apply to linear supplies only.

## 3D Printed Parts

- Vent grills, fan mounts, and strain reliefs.
