# RF Power Meters

Date: 2026-01-13

## Theory

- Power meters sample RF and convert to voltage for display.
- Directional couplers separate forward and reflected power.

## Design Calculations

- P = V^2 / R for the measured sample.
- Coupler factor sets the scale calibration.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Not modeled in NEC; verify with a known dummy load.

## Winding Tables

- Current transformer turns may be needed for HF samplers.

## 3D Printed Parts

- Meter bezel, PCB standoffs, and connector mounts.
