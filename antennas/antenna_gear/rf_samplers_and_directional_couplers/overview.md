# RF Samplers and Directional Couplers

Date: 2026-01-13

## Theory

- Directional couplers sample RF with minimal insertion loss.
- Directivity sets the accuracy of forward/reflected readings.

## Design Calculations

- Coupling factor and line impedance define output level.
- Quarter-wave and transformer-based designs cover HF.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Model coupling lines or transformers in NEC where applicable.

## Winding Tables

- Transformer-based couplers need turns tables for balance.

## 3D Printed Parts

- Shielded enclosure and sample port mounts.
