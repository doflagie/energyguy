# RFI Shielding

Date: 2026-01-13

## Theory

- Conductive enclosures reduce radiated and conducted interference.
- Shielding effectiveness depends on conductivity and seam integrity.
- Vent and cable entry points are the dominant leakage paths.

## Design Calculations

- Skin depth: delta = sqrt(2 / (omega * mu * sigma)).
- Estimate required thickness and mesh size for the target band.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Not modeled directly in NEC; treat as boundary constraints.

## Winding Tables

- Not coil-based; focus on bonding and seam treatments.

## 3D Printed Parts

- Shielded box panels, gasket grooves, and cable gland inserts.
