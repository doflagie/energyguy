# Roller Inductors

Date: 2026-01-13

## Theory

- Roller inductors provide continuous inductance adjustment.
- Current handling depends on contact and coil diameter.

## Design Calculations

- Compute inductance per turn for the coil geometry.
- Estimate current at the highest reactive load.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Model as a variable series L in NEC.

## Winding Tables

- Create a position-to-inductance table for the roller.

## 3D Printed Parts

- End plates, roller carrier, and shaft coupler mounts.
