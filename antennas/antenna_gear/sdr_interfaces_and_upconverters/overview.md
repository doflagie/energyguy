# SDR Interfaces and Upconverters

Date: 2026-01-13

## Theory

- Upconverters shift HF to a higher IF for SDR coverage.
- Mixers and filters control images and spurs.

## Design Calculations

- LO frequency sets IF: IF = RF + LO or RF - LO.
- Filter bandwidth must cover the desired spectrum.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Not modeled in NEC; use NEC for antenna impedance reference.

## Winding Tables

- Transformers for baluns or mixers may require turns tables.

## 3D Printed Parts

- Shielded enclosure, connector mounts, and heatsink tabs.
