# Tower and Mast Systems

Date: 2026-01-13

## Theory

- Structures provide elevation and stability for antennas.
- Guying and anchoring control sway and wind load.

## Design Calculations

- Compute wind load, overturning moment, and guy tension.
- Select safety factors for local wind code.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Not modeled in NEC; model antenna only and include height.

## Winding Tables

- Not coil-based.

## 3D Printed Parts

- Guy plate, mast clamp, and standoff brackets.
