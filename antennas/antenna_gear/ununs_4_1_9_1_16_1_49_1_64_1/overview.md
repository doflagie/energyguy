# UNUNs (4:1, 9:1, 16:1, 49:1, 64:1)

Date: 2026-01-13

## Theory

- Ununs are unbalanced transformers for end-fed or random-wire antennas.
- Autotransformer taps provide the impedance ratio.
- Ground or counterpoise is required for stable performance.

## Design Calculations

- Impedance ratio = turns_ratio^2 with tap method.
- Check core flux and loss for the target power.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Model as a series transformer and feedpoint load in NEC.
- Include a counterpoise or ground system in the model.

## Winding Tables

- Compute turns for each ratio and document tap locations.

## 3D Printed Parts

- Weatherproof enclosure, N-type or SO-239 mount, and strain relief.
