# Variable Capacitors

Date: 2026-01-13

## Theory

- Variable capacitors tune resonance in antennas and transmitters.
- Plate spacing sets voltage rating; overlap sets capacitance.

## Design Calculations

- C range must cover the required tuning range.
- Check RF voltage at resonance to size spacing.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Model as a variable shunt or series capacitor in NEC.

## Winding Tables

- Not coil-based; focus on mechanical and voltage limits.

## 3D Printed Parts

- Mounting brackets, shaft supports, and knob adapters.
