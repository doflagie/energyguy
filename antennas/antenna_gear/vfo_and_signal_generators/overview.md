# VFO and Signal Generators

Date: 2026-01-13

## Theory

- VFOs use LC or DDS sources for stable frequency generation.
- Signal generators require output level control and filtering.

## Design Calculations

- LC tank frequency is set by coil and capacitor values.
- Stability improves with temperature compensation.

## EZNEC / NEC Modeling

- Not modeled in NEC; use for test signal injection.

## Winding Tables

- Coil inductance sets the VFO range; compute turns vs L.

## 3D Printed Parts

- Knobs, dial plate, and shielded oscillator compartment.
