# Design Calculations for Dipole Antenna

Date: 2026-01-12

- Compute wavelength: lambda(m) = 300 / f(MHz).
- Half-wave length L0 = lambda / 2.
- Apply velocity factor and end effect: L = L0 * VF * K.
- Typical K is 0.95 to 0.98 depending on wire diameter and height.
- Each leg length = L / 2.
- Estimate feed impedance with height; expect 50-75 ohms for HF.
- Adjust length after installation by trimming or adding length.
