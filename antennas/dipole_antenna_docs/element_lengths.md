# Calculating Exact Element Lengths

Date: 2026-01-12

- Compute wavelength: lambda(m) = 300 / f(MHz).
- Half-wave length L0 = lambda / 2.
- Apply velocity factor and end effect: L = L0 * VF * K.
- Typical K ranges 0.95 to 0.98 depending on diameter and height.
- Split into two equal legs, then trim for resonance.
