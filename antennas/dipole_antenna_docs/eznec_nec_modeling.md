- Define geometry: two wire segments with a center feed point.
- Use at least 20 segments per half-wave; segment length <= 0.05 lambda.
- Specify wire diameter and height above ground.
- Select ground model (free space, perfect, or real ground).
- Add a voltage source at the center segment.
- Sweep frequency to see resonance and impedance shift.
- Check current distribution and pattern broadside to the wire.
