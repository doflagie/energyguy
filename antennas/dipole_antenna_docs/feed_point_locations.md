# Calculating Exact Feed Point Locations

Date: 2026-01-12

- A standard dipole is center-fed at the current maximum.
- Off-center-fed positions raise impedance and allow multi-band use.
- Typical OCF ratios are 1/3 or 2/5 of the total length.
- Model impedance vs feed position to match your transformer.
