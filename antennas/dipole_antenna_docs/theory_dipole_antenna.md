# Theory of Dipole Antennas

Date: 2026-01-12

- A half-wave dipole is two quarter-wave conductors fed at the center.
- Current is maximum at the feed point and tapers toward the ends.
- The dipole has a doughnut-shaped radiation pattern broadside to the wire.
- Free-space feed impedance is about 73 ohms and varies with height.
- Height above ground changes take-off angle and impedance.
- A dipole is a reference antenna for gain comparisons (0 dBd).
- Shortening the dipole lowers efficiency and raises reactance.
- Balanced feed lines reduce common-mode currents.
- Environment (trees, roofs, metal) detunes the antenna.
