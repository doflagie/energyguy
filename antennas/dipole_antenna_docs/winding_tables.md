# Calculating Winding Tables

Date: 2026-01-12

- Winding tables are used for loading coils or matching transformers.
- Select target inductance L and coil form dimensions.
- For air-core solenoid: L(uH) = (r^2 * N^2) / (9r + 10l).
- Solve for turns N and calculate turn spacing.
- For ferrite cores, use AL: L(nH) = AL * N^2.
- Create tap tables for different inductance values.
- Validate with an LCR meter when possible.
