# Theory of Dipole

Date: 2026-01-13

- A half-wave dipole is two quarter-wave conductors fed at center.
- Current is maximum at the feed and tapers toward the ends.
- Pattern is broadside to the wire with a doughnut shape.
- Free-space feed impedance is about 73 ohms.
- Height above ground changes take-off angle and impedance.
