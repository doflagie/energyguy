# Theory of End Fed Random Wire

Date: 2026-01-13

- End Fed Random Wire behavior depends on electrical length, height, and nearby objects.
- Current distribution drives the radiation pattern and feed impedance.
- Ground conductivity and mounting height affect take-off angle and efficiency.
- Feed line and support materials can introduce detuning.
- Modeling improves accuracy over closed-form estimates.
