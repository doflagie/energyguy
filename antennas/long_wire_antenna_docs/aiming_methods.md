- Long wires radiate strongest off the wire ends when length > 1 lambda.
- Orient the wire so the main lobes point toward the target area.
- Use modeling to find lobe angles at your operating frequency.
- For short wires (< 0.5 lambda), broadside radiation is dominant.
- Confirm direction with on-air reports or beacons.
