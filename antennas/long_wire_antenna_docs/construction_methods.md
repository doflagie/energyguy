- Choose copper-clad steel or stranded copper wire for strength.
- Use UV-resistant insulators and rope for outdoor durability.
- Solder or crimp ring lugs to prevent wire fatigue at connections.
- Weatherproof the feed point with heat shrink and silicone sealant.
- Provide strain relief so the feed line does not carry mechanical load.
