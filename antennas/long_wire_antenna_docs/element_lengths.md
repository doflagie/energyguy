# Calculating Exact Element Lengths

Date: 2026-01-12

- Compute wavelength: lambda(m) = 300 / f(MHz).
- Start with half-wave length: L0 = lambda / 2.
- Apply velocity factor (VF) and end effect: L = L0 * VF * K.
- Typical K ranges 0.95 to 0.98 depending on diameter and height.
- For long wires, choose L = n * (lambda/2) and refine by model.
- Trim in small steps and re-measure SWR to final value.
