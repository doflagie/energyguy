# Design Calculations for Loop Antenna

Date: 2026-01-12

- Compute wavelength: lambda(m) = 300 / f(MHz).
- Full-wave loop perimeter P = lambda * VF.
- For square loop, side length = P / 4.
- For triangle loop, side length = P / 3.
- Apply end effect factor K ~ 0.95 to 0.98 for wire loops.
- Estimate feed impedance with height; typical 100-130 ohms in free space.
- Small loops require tuning capacitance to resonate.
