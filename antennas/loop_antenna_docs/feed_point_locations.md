# Calculating Exact Feed Point Locations

Date: 2026-01-12

- For full-wave loops, feed at a current maximum (midpoint of a side).
- For small loops, feed across the tuning capacitor or coupling loop.
- Model impedance vs feed location for desired match.
- Maintain symmetry to reduce pattern distortion.
