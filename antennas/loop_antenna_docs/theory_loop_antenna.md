# Theory of Loop Antennas

Date: 2026-01-12

- Loop antennas are closed conductors; full-wave loops are efficient radiators.
- Large loops (circumference ~1 lambda) have low-angle radiation and gain.
- Small loops (<< 0.1 lambda) are magnetic loops with high Q and narrow bandwidth.
- Current is distributed around the loop; voltage peaks at the feed point.
- Feed impedance depends on size, height, and loop shape.
- Loops are often quieter on receive due to reduced E-field pickup.
- Coupling can be direct feed or via a coupling loop.
- Nearby conductive objects detune the loop and reduce efficiency.
