# Matching Methods of Phased Array of 2 Antennas

Date: 2026-01-13

- Measure or model the feed impedance at the target frequency.
- Choose transformer or L-network values for the impedance ratio.
- Add a current balun or choke to limit common-mode currents.
- Tune residual reactance with a matching network or tuner.
