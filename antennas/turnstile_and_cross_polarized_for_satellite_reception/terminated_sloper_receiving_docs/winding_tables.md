# Winding Tables of Terminated Sloper Receiving

Date: 2026-01-13

- Winding tables are used for loading coils or transformers.
- Choose target inductance L and coil form dimensions.
- Air-core solenoid: L(uH) = (r^2 * N^2) / (9r + 10l).
- Ferrite cores: L(nH) = AL * N^2.
- Build a turns vs inductance table for tap points.
